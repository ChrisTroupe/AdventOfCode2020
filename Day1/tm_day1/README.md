# TM

Day 1 solution. Trying Elixir for the first time. Solutions are not the most efficient.

Compile and open iex session: `mix compile && iex -S mix`

For problem 1: `TM.get_multiple_from_file("input.txt", 2)`

For problem 2: `TM.get_multiple_from_file("input.txt", 3)`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tm_day1` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tm_day1, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tm_day1](https://hexdocs.pm/tm_day1).
