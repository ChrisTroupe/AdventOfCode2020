Try to follow a general format that is clear when naming your input/solutions. 

For example, use initials_(solution/input)_programmingLanguage.fileExtension (or another clear format).

I was just planning on using Day1..Day30 as the naming convention and putting everything in there. I believe most days the solutions to both problems will be fairly similar so you should be able to use one file but if not feel free to add file1 or file2 etc.
