# TM

Day 1 solution. Trying Elixir for the first time. Solutions are not the most efficient.

Compile and open iex session: `mix compile && iex -S mix`

For problem 1: `Day1.part1`

For problem 2: `Day1.part2`

> Replace `Day1` with the respective day (i.e. `Day2.part1`, `Day20.part2`)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tm_day1` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tm_day1, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
